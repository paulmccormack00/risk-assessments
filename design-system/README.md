> Design reference for Risk Assessments — extracted from Complio's assessments module.
> Status: Stub — to be completed.

## TODO

- [ ] Define brand identity (standalone vs Complio sub-brand)
- [ ] Define colour palette — likely inherits from Complio (EU Blue #003399 + Kormoon green #7dbb91)
- [ ] Define typography (font family, scale)
- [ ] Define component patterns (risk matrices, assessment forms, scoring UI)
- [ ] Confirm whether this shares Complio's design language or diverges

## Notes

- Extracted from Complio's assessments module
- Supabase local at pablomini-server:54521
- Likely shares Complio brand DNA — confirm before creating divergent styles
- See Complio design system: /Users/server/projects/complio/design-system/README.md
